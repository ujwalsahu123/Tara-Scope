GET 3_d model , laser and laser part from robu. 

1_calibration -> 1 week (sensor manaul read, yellow_file read, calib code read, understand all, mag.py & mag.ino code write , gyro calib, acc think what to do- my previous reading or new reading using motors.)

2_sensor-fusion -> 1 week (full see and understand it, watch videos , use cpp code not python, since slow, write sf.ino code which reads raw values and gives nice RPY. )

3_laser -> 2 days (setup kar and check if it works)

3_motor-code -> 2 days ( run the 1_controlled.py code with laser , then write the 3_full-motor-code.ino which is basically mix of Sf.ino code , Motor pointing logic , and laserfade function. )
    
4_star - pointing  -> 1 week
                    0_basic_pointing - use the ai-guide code to simply calculate the alt az and then send it to full-motor-code 
                    1_star_calib - use the 0_basic_pointing code and controlled-by-button code to get the offset.
                    2_use_offset - same as 0_basic_pointing
                    4_main.py 
                    5_debug - rethink and make the pointing more accurate

5_destop app -> max 1 week

4_stellector study -> 1 week

6_intro website -> 1 week

7_documentation -> 1 week (each code file explain, write small research paper, working viedo make and put on yt)

8_Grant -> 1 week - make pitch deck , pitch video , think business , etc todo see and notes see. 

9_if-funded -> Gpt staragazer - read and think vision / ideate ( and be founder - and only focus to grow, and get team to build things)
