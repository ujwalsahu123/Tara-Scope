make a git file and connect it with the remote repo . so that i can push the chnages over there.

read - entire book/sheet notes, codes, this todo.txt, think, stellector pdf - and make a proper todo - (of the building stuff - no entp , hiring , fund stuff.) 
and update this todo list. 

also collect the materials - pdfs , presentations / deck , WhatsApp (write in txt), google notes (write in txt), phone images of table - write it down in sheet. 


1 calibration do - see the clg table image in phone. 
the issue was -> the motor movement speed and wait and then take reading, ...
2 sensor fusion - ( library may i did changes )
  implement sensor fusion in Arduino
  quartanian seen , test on mac also . 
3 motor code and testing - 
-need to do testing -see clg table image in phone (write code to move the motors to the star and then see the star ka altaz and see the sensor ka altaz.)
also we can use the stellarium app code for testing , we can point to the star and see if it actually points. 
-(the sensor and laser may not be fully parallel. so for that what we were doing is we made a scope alignment using screws, but instead of that we can do is -> use the stellector ka idea (where they were - doing 3/5 star alignment - they are moving the motors to point the stars and then checking the difference between - that star altaz and sensor ka altaz , and that difference was laser offset. and then whenever they were pointing to other stars they were considering the offset) - so this is better approach that my laser adjustment method) 
- the motor code is in aurdino code.txt file for mpu9050 so we can use it for the new sensor. - also if we use the stellector ka 3d print then need to update the motor code as per that that.
- and if we use the stellector ka 3d print - then need to also update the calibration, etc code as per the 3d models movement. 
- if using the slettector model - then need to think how to position the sensor (flat of as per the they did) (since when the sensor reaches 90deg + then fluctualte hota hai readings. ( flat sensor par laser point to zeinith is good in this setup i think so)
- also alt az ka bhi soochna hoga seen for this stellector model. 


**** the best is do - 1 ,2 , 3 using my hardware setup and then do - stellector fully reimplement with my sensor (so learn the stellector full) 
and then pick the good stuff - ( my calib , sensor fusion technique , and stellectors - pointing , etc stuff)

the main thing i can do is calibration and sensor-fusion. (other stuff are already done by stellector - so i will copy that)
and then do the desktop app and ai stuff. etc.
