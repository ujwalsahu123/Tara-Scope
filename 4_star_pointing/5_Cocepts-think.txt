go and read the Stellector_learn gpt. and know the problem -> 
problems : 
making the AZ motor continous 360+ . and it finds the shorter route. 
at zeinith most stars are super close -> so if you go by manual alt az control then need to move very a lot. so instead we can make the alt go beyond 90+ deg and we make the AZ file by 180 deg . which can save a lot of Travel of AZ (we can save upto 180 of AZ travel by going alt 90 and Jumping the AZ to +-180 deg.)
at zeinith the sensor ALT readings go crazy. so point the laser to zeinith at flat sensor. 


1. making the az motors contineous. so that it can go form 355 to 10 deg. 
2. the ALT motors moves 180 degree, so that for stars which are very closer to zenith - starA alt 85 , az 0 . starB alt 80 , az 180 .  ( so if we keep the alt range of 90 deg then the AZ motor has to travel long distance (even if it finds the shorter part by contineous rotation) and then alt motor moves by 5  degree (from 85 to 80) .  but if we keep the alt range of 180 degree then the the alt motor moves 15 deg (from 85 to 100) , and when the alt motor goes 90+ then the AZ shifts by 180. and then the Az motor moves.  so this technique lets up move quicker for the zenith stars. ) also this is hard to implement. 
3 keeping the sensor alt 0 at zeinith . since - most of the stars are at zeinith and a very few at the horizon . ( so when we move the sensors to alt around 80 , 90 , 90 + then it dosent give a good reading, so we can add a constant +90 deg, after calculating the alt . so that the when sensor is flat on surface -> 0 deg alt then it will show 90 deg alt.) so this can help us to point accuratly at zeinith and can go 90+ deg easily as mentioned in ideas 2.  and when pointing we just simply also have to add +90 to the Target_alt variable. 

so i need to more think on this . and visualize it.  
- contineous motion of AZ and fining shorter path. 
- making alt motor 180 range , and need to think how it does 90+ and flips the AZ jump by 180. so that shorter path. 
- need to think about the orientation of the sensors and laser (at actual alt 0 we keep its alt 90 and place the laser in the zeinith) so at flat sensor the laser points to zeinith.  and if target_alt is 20 then we do +90 . 
other ex- we found from idea 2 that moving the alt motor 90+ is shorter part so we flip the AZ. in this case - we need to do -90 int he target_alt... ... i am not clear and need to think on this. 

all these 3 things are super imp and these techniques can be a gamechanger. since no one else have thought applying this techniques. not even - website one , not even stellector . so need to work on it. and need to first clear the concept that how this will work.
